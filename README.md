# Digital-Image-Proessing
This course is designed to introduce students about the techniques of digital image processing. It includes the acquisition of digital images, manipulation procedures and further enhance to improve the high quality of image. Different types of manipulation and enhancement techniques will be covered. At the end of the course, students are expected to implement concepts of image processing, generating and manipulating images.



Assignment 1 –Basic Operation in Digital Image Processing

You are instructed to build and develop an interactive 2D Image Manipulation Editor. The editor comprises several basic image manipulation features such as loading image, geometric transformation of image, color conversion (gray scale to rgb color to hsv and vice versa) and etc. In addition, your editor should have a function that save the image after executing basic image manipulation tasks.




Assignment 2 –Mid-range Digital Image Editor

You are instructed to build, develop and further enhance your 2D image editor by implementing several image processing filter techniques that you have learnt in the class and tutorial. The requested features to add are
      • Split and merge several images
      • Find the histogram equalization of an image
      • Enhance and restore image (must use at least two low-pass filtering techniques and two high-pass filtering techniques)
In addition, your editor should have function that could save the enhanced image in jpeg, bmp or tiff format.
